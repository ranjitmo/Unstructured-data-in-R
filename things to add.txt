We see that ... but at this point it would be interesting to put the crash location ... into context by taking into account ..
We won't go there as this tutorial was more about the mechanics of getting unstructed data from the web and doing something with it. 
We achieved that by visualizing the locations of air crashes on a world map where bubble size represents no. fatalities of each crash.

* does time affect crashes?
* is there any seasonality?

* next to expand, how can we get tooltips (leaflet)? put categorical variable in (airplane make), filter to 'big crashes'
 
* filter to last 5 years? Fix big crashes with NA as lonlat - what causes this?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include=FALSE}
path <- getwd()
crash_df <- read_csv( paste0(path, "/crash_data.csv") ) # reading in past 10 years worth of air accident data
mp <- NULL
mapWorld <- borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50") # create a layer of borders
mp <- ggplot() + 
  mapWorld + 
  geom_point(aes(x=crash_df$lon, y=crash_df$lat), color="blue", size=sqrt(crash_df$Fatalities), alpha = 0.5) 

mp
```
